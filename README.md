# Final project 
Project overview
My project is a web app which could store information about the Uber or Lyft experience. The website includes two kinds of user, driver and passenger. In the first iteration, I update the login page.

In the login page we can sign in as a driver or a passenger. You need to register if you are not a user.

the data will be stored into the local database, which I used Xmapp to visualize it.

After I register, I can sign in

If you input wrong password, it will remind you and you need to sign in again.

In my project's first iteration, I moved my project from localhost to firebase, which will provide me a domain with a protocol and not including localhost. And I created the login and register page . Then I also Integrate Google Sign-In into my web app. Which could allow the people login with their google account. Besides that, I also created the database and the user could create the account. But once you're logged in, you don't have sign out and sign in with different account if you want to switch from driver to passenger. For my final iteration I want to fix the php problem when I moving it to firebase. I also need to collect the user's information when they trying to sign in with their google account.
